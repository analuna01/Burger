## Description
This application is a burger logger that was created with MySQL database, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

## Usage
Users can add a burger to be added to a list of "Burgers Created!" that will automatically generate a button to click when they are ready to eat it. Once the user clicks on the "Eat Burger" button, the burger will then be moved to the "Burgers Devoured!" list and the information will be saved for the users' convenience.
